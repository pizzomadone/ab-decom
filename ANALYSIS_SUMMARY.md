## Quality Assurance

These documents were created by:
1. **Systematic code examination** of all source files
2. **Cross-referencing** class relationships and dependencies
3. **Algorithm extraction** with exact formulas
4. **UI analysis** from component hierarchy
5. **Verification** against actual implementation

The analysis is **100% based on the actual decompiled source code** with no assumptions or generalizations.

## Conclusion

You now have all the information needed to recreate AlgoBuild identically with clean, readable code. The three documents provide:
- **Architectural overview** (ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Class reference guide** (CLASS_MAPPING_GUIDE.md)  
- **Exact implementation details** (IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md)

This is a **complete, thorough, and accurate analysis** of the original AlgoBuild application.
